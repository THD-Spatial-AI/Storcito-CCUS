          The analysis results produced by the App platform are based on data
          from sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM), MERRA-2, and other public datasets. While we
          strive for accuracy, these simulations are intended for informational and research
          purposes and should not be solely relied upon for emergency response, evacuation
          planning, or other safety-critical decisions. To continuously improve the platform, we
          analyze user-generated models and outcomes to refine our estimation techniques and data
